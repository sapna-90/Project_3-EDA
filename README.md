# Project_3-EDA
Housing Data Analysis Project
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a housing dataset to understand the factors influencing house prices.
The analysis also includes effective handling of missing values.
Key Analysis include examining the impact of various amenities and customer preferences on house prices through visualizations like scatter plots, box plots, hist plots.
Further feature engineering is applied to create new insights such as to capture relevant information for pricing analysis.
Additionally, regression techniques are applied to predict house prices accurately.
The project is structured into Google colab and Python scripts for easy replication and extension.
